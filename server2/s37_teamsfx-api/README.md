# Microsoft Teams Development Community Samples

This repository contains community samples that demonstrate different usage patterns for developing on Microsoft Teams as a platform. Samples are generally not production-ready, but are intended to show developers specific patterns and use cases for use in complete applications.

> We welcome community contributions to the samples folder in this repository for demonstrating different patterns and use cases with Microsoft Teams. Please see our [contribution guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.

> If you use 3rd party libraries, please make sure that library license allows distributions of it as part of your sample.

Microsoft Teams is highly extensible, allowing 3rd party and custom applications to run alongside the many Office 365 services already included in Teams. Just as you can add a Word tab or the Who bot in Teams, you can write your own tabs and bots. You can also write applications that run outside the Teams UI and use the Microsoft Graph API to access and curate Teams content.

The best way to navigate the samples is to use the [Sample Navigator](https://pnp.github.io/teams-dev-samples/). It will allow you to dial in the Teams app features, language, and other technologies you want samples for.

The samples folder contains a folder for each sample, named with a prefix as follows:

| Prefix | Description |
| --- | --- |
| app- | These are samples of apps that have multiple features such as a tab and a bot |
| bot- | These are simple bots, intended to show a single capability or pattern |
| connector- | These are connectors which send notifications to Teams channels and optionally O365 groups in Outlook
| msgext- | These are simple messaging extensions, intended to show a single capability or pattern |
| tabs- | These are simple tabs, intended to show a single capability or pattern |

## Questions or Problems?

Please do not open GitHub issues for  support questions with Microsoft 365 or developer tools. The GitHub issues list should be used for sample requests and bug reports. This way we can more easily track actual issues or bugs from the code and keep the general discussion separate from the actual code.

If you have questions about how to develop Teams applications or any of the provided samples, please use the following resources:

## Using the samples

Due to the diversity of the samples and technologies, there are no fixed instructions for building or using the samples. Each sample should include a readme file with build instructions.

## Contributions

These samples are from the Microsoft 365 developer community. We welcome your samples and suggestions for new samples.
