# Action Preview - Microsoft Teams App

## Summary

This small demo sample is an **action** based messaging extension created using the Teams Yeoman Generator as featured in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1eANUbqaRs&list=PLR9nK3mnD-OUeDoawdmYJJsTlRHd6p5DB&index=7&t=7s). It posts a simple adaptive card to the Team's news channel but 'as a bot' and with an action to update the same adaptive card again and again.

## Frameworks

## Prerequisites

* [Office 365 tenant](https://dev.office.com/sharepoint/docs/spfx/set-up-your-development-environment)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) version 12.13.0 or higher
* [Gulp task runner](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-cli/v/2.2.0) - install by typing `npm install yo gulp-cli --global`
* [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) or similar tunneling application is required for local testing

    ```bash
    # determine node version
    node --version
    ```

## Minimal Path to Awesome
- Clone the repository and navigate to the project folder

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/pnp/teams-dev-samples.git
    cd teams-dev-samples/samples/msgext-action-preview
    ```

- Install modules

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
- Run ngrok and note down the given url

    ```bash
    gulp start-ngrok
    ```
- Since messaging extensions utilize the Azure Bot Framework, you will need to register a new bot. 
[These instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/bots/how-to/create-a-bot-for-teams#register-your-web-service-with-the-bot-framework) provide options for registering with or without an Azure subscription. 
  - Be sure to enable the Microsoft Teams bot channel so your solution can communicate with Microsoft Teams
  - For local testing, set the messaging endpoint to the https URL returned by ngrok plus "/api/messages"
  - Note the bot's Application ID and password (also called the Client Secret) assigned to your bot during the registration process. In the Azure portal this is under the Bot Registration settings; in the legacy portal it's in the Settings tab. Click Manage to go to Azure AD to obtain the Client Secret. You may need to create a new Application Secret in order to have an opportunity to copy it out of the Azure portal. 
- Update the `.env` configuration for the bot to use the Microsoft App Id and App Password (aka Client Secret) from the previous step.

## Building the manifest

To create the Microsoft Teams Apps manifest, run the `manifest` Gulp task. This will generate and validate the package and finally create the package (a zip file) in the `package` folder. The manifest will be validated against the schema and dynamically populated with values from the `.env` file.

``` bash
gulp manifest
```

  Upload the resulting zip file into Teams [using these instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/deploy-and-publish/apps-upload).

- Run the bot locally
    ```bash
    gulp serve
    ```

- Test in Microsoft Teams by clicking the ... beneath the compose box in a Team where the application has been installed.

## Features

This is a simple Action based messaging extension using the following features:
* [Post an adaptive card](https://adaptivecards.io/)
* Use botmessagepreview to send messages 'as a bot'
* Use updateActivity() to update those messages / adaptive cards at a later point of time

## Debug and test locally

To debug and test the solution locally you use the `serve` Gulp task. This will first build the app and then start a local web server on port 3007, where you can test your Tabs, Bots or other extensions. Also this command will rebuild the App if you change any file in the `/src` directory.

``` bash
gulp serve
```

To debug the code you can append the argument `debug` to the `serve` command as follows. This allows you to step through your code using your preferred code editor.

``` bash
gulp serve --debug
```
To step through code in Visual Studio Code you need to add the following snippet in the `./.vscode/launch.json` file. Once done, you can easily attach to the node process after running the `gulp server --debug` command.

``` json
{
    "type": "node",
    "request": "attach",
    "name": "Attach",
    "port": 5858,
    "sourceMaps": true,
    "outFiles": [
        "${workspaceRoot}/dist/**/*.js"
    ],
    "remoteRoot": "${workspaceRoot}/src/"
},
```

### Using ngrok for local development and hosting

In order to make development locally a great experience it is recommended to use [ngrok](https://ngrok.io), which allows you to publish the localhost on a public DNS, so that you can consume the bot and the other resources in Microsoft Teams. 

To use ngrok, it is recommended to use the `gulp ngrok-serve` command, which will read your ngrok settings from the `.env` file and automatically create a correct manifest file and finally start a local development server using the ngrok settings.

For an even better expereince you can
- Fire up **two** command prompts
- Both switch to local directory of your solution
- In one call gulp start-ngrok
- In the other only run gulp serve --debug
  - This one you can now start and stop as often as you want without losing your temp. Url

### Additional build options

You can use the following flags for the `serve`, `ngrok-serve` and build commands:

* `--no-linting` - skips the linting of Typescript during build to improve build times
* `--debug` - builds in debug mode

## Deployment

The solution can be deployed to Azure using any deployment method.

* For Azure Devops see [How to deploy a Yo Teams generated project to Azure through Azure DevOps](https://www.wictorwilen.se/blog/deploying-yo-teams-and-node-apps/)
* For Docker containers, see the included `Dockerfile`

## Logging

To enable logging for the solution you need to add `msteams` to the `DEBUG` environment variable. See the [debug package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug) for more information. By default this setting is turned on in the `.env` file.

Example for Windows command line:

``` bash
SET DEBUG=msteams
```

If you are using Microsoft Azure to host your Microsoft Teams app, then you can add `DEBUG` as an Application Setting with the value of `msteams`.
