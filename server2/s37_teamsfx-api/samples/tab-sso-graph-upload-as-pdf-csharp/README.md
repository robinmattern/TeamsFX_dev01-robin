# tab-sso-graph-upload-pdf-csharp

## Summary
This Teams Tab enables a user to upload a supported ("csv", "doc", "docx", "odp", "ods", "odt", "pot", "potm", "potx", "pps", "ppsx", "ppsxm", "ppt", "pptm", "pptx", "rtf", "xls", "xlsx") file type via drag and drop while the uploaded file will be converted as PDF.
In Teams context it uses the current channel as a Folder name in the default drive of current team.
It uses the following capabilities (mostly) on behalf of Microsoft Graph:
* Use HTML5 drag and drop event handling
* Writing normal files smaller 4MB
* Retrieving files with format=pdf conversion
