## Minimal Path to Awesome
- Clone the repository
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/pnp/teams-dev-samples.git
- Open samples\tab-sso-graph-file-conversion-csharp\tab-sso-graph-file-conversion.sln in Visual Studio
- Perform first actions in GettingStarted.txt (before hitting F5)
- This should [register an app in Azure AD](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/add-single-sign-on?pivots=visual-studio&WT.mc_id=M365-MVP-5004617#add-sso-to-teams-app-for-visual-studio)
- Ensure there is an app 
  - with redirect uri https://localhost/blank-auth-end.html
  - SignInAudience multi-tenant
  - with client secret
  - with **delegated** permissions Files.ReadWrite and Sites.ReadWrite.All
  - With exposed Api "access_as_user" and App ID Uri api://localhost/<App ID>
  - With the client IDs for Teams App and Teams Web App 1fec8e78-bce4-4aaf-ab1b-5451cc387264 and 5e3ce6c0-2b1f-4285-8d4b-75ee78787346
- Find/Add the app registration ClientId, ClientSecret to your appsettings.json (or a appsettings.Development.json)
- Find/Fill OAuthAuthority with https://login.microsoftonline.com/_YOUR_TENANTID_
- Grant admin consent to the given permissions in the app registration
- Now you are good to go to continue in GettingStarted.txt with hitting F5 (You can also select an installed browser in the VS menu)
