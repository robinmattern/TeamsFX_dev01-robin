## Minimal Path to Awesome
- Clone the repository
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/pnp/teams-dev-samples.git
    ```

- In a console, navigate to `/samples/tab-office-offer-creation`

    ```bash
    cd /samples/tab-office-offer-creation
    ```

- Install modules

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
- Create the content-type for your offers in a site / default document library of your choice
    - With PnP-PowerShell for instance call the deploy script with your site url as parameter
        ```bash
        .\templates\deploy.ps1 -siteUrl <YourFullSiteUrl>
    
    - Put the same site url to your .env as SiteUrl=
- You will need to register an app in Azure AD [also described here](https://mmsharepoint.wordpress.com/2021/09/07/meeting-apps-in-microsoft-teams-1-pre-meeting/#appreg)
  - with client secret
  - with **delegated** SharePoint permissions AllSites.Write 
  - With exposed Api "access_as_user" and App ID Uri api://{NGrok-Url}/{App ID}
  - With the client IDs for Teams App and Teams Web App 1fec8e78-bce4-4aaf-ab1b-5451cc387264 and 5e3ce6c0-2b1f-4285-8d4b-75ee78787346
  - Also With the client IDs for Office Apps Office web	4765445b-32c6-49b0-83e6-1d93765276ca, Office desktop 0ec893e0-5785-4de6-99da-4ed124e5296c,
Outlook desktop, mobile	d3590ed6-52b3-4102-aeff-aad2292ab01c, Outlook web bc59ab01-8403-45c6-8796-ac3ef710b3e3
- Also add the app ID and its secret to .env (taken from .env-sample) as TAB_APP_ID= and 
    - add the secret to TAB_APP_SECRET=
- Since messaging extensions utilize the Azure Bot Framework, you will need to register a new bot. 
[These instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/sbs-messagingextension-searchcommand?tabs=latestversionofvisualstudio&tutorial-step=3&WT.mc_id=M365-MVP-5004617) provide options for registering with or without an Azure subscription. 
  - Be sure to enable the Microsoft Teams, Outlook AND Microsoft 365 Extensions bot channel so your solution can communicate with Microsoft Teams AND Outlook
  - For local testing, set the messaging endpoint to the https URL returned by ngrok plus "/api/messages" otherwise to your Azure App host url
- Also add the bot's app ID and its secret to .env (taken from .env-sample) as MICROSOFT_APP_ID= and 
    - add the secret to MICROSOFT_APP_PASSWORD= 
- In the Bot itself add the app id and secret as "GraphConnection" with app id, tenant id, secret and scope=https://graph.microsoft.com/.default
    - Use Azure Active Directory V2 as service provider
    - Use the configured App URI configured also to your **bot's app registration** in the format api://{NGrok-Url}/{App ID} as Token Exchange URL
    - Add the client IDs for Teams App and Teams Web App 1fec8e78-bce4-4aaf-ab1b-5451cc387264 and 5e3ce6c0-2b1f-4285-8d4b-75ee78787346
    - Also add the client IDs for Outlook desktop, mobile d3590ed6-52b3-4102-aeff-aad2292ab01c, Outlook web bc59ab01-8403-45c6-8796-ac3ef710b3e3, 00000002-0000-0ff1-ce00-000000000000

## Additional build options

You can use the following flags for the `serve`, `ngrok-serve` and build commands:

* `--no-linting` or `-l` - skips the linting of Typescript during build to improve build times
* `--debug` - builds in debug mode and significantly improves build time with support for hot reloading of client side components
* `--env <filename>.env` - use an alternate set of environment files
* `--publish` - automatically publish the application to the Teams App store

## Deployment

The solution can be deployed to Azure using any deployment method.

* For Azure Devops see [How to deploy a Yo Teams generated project to Azure through Azure DevOps](https://www.wictorwilen.se/blog/deploying-yo-teams-and-node-apps/)
* For Docker containers, see the included `Dockerfile`

## Logging

To enable logging for the solution you need to add `msteams` to the `DEBUG` environment variable. See the [debug package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug) for more information. By default this setting is turned on in the `.env` file.

Example for Windows command line:

``` bash
SET DEBUG=msteams
```

If you are using Microsoft Azure to host your Microsoft Teams app, then you can add `DEBUG` as an Application Setting with the value of `msteams`.
