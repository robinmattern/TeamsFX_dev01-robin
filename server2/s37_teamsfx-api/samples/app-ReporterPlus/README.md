# ReporterPlus – Teams Device Capabilities Application.  

## Summary

The sample app demonstrates the power of integrating Teams platform with device capabilities such as camera, QR or barcode scanner, photo gallery and microphone. This integration reduces the barrier to app development, speeds-up development-cycle, and creates new scenarios or use-cases for the developer community.<br/>
Teams apps allow end users to do more by directly integrating with native device capabilities. This integration also reduces the barrier to app development, speeds-up development-cycle, and creates new scenarios or use-cases for the developer community.<br/>
The sample allows end users to capture and report incidents / tasks / tickets for approval. While the sample app can be used in varied scenarios or use cases, for the purpose of demonstration and walkthrough, we assume the sample is being used for submitting a request for replacing a damaged office asset.

### Submitting a request

* The sample makes use of an action-based Messaging extension to invoke the submission flow from any scope (1:1 chat, group chat, channel).
* In the task module interface, app allows user to scan an asset using [QR / Barcode scanner](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/device-capabilities/qr-barcode-scanner-capability).
* App makes use People picker component to view and select other users for approving requests.
* App makes use of [device’s camera and annotation capabilities](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/device-capabilities/mobile-camera-image-permissions) to take a picture, annotate and add to request.
* Device’s microphone is used to record an optional voice message that will be submitted to the approver.

### Approving request

* Adaptive card is posted in the same scope where messaging extension was invoked.
* Adaptive card with request for approval is also sent to the approver’s email as [actionable message](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/task-modules-and-cards/cards/universal-actions-for-adaptive-cards/overview?tabs=mobile#universal-actions).
* Requester and approver view different views of the same Adaptive card as the app leverages [user specific views](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/task-modules-and-cards/cards/universal-actions-for-adaptive-cards/user-specific-views?tabs=mobile).

![drop](https://img.shields.io/badge/Bot&nbsp;Framework-4.0-green.svg)

## Prerequisites

* [Office 365 tenant](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/dev-program).

* An Azure account with an active subscription. For details, see [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).

* [Visual Studio (2019 and above)](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/), [.NET Core 3.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1) (Make sure to install version that corresponds with your visual studio instance, 32 vs 64 bit)

* To test locally, you'll need [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) installed on your local machine. ngrok will tunnel requests from the Internet to your local computer and terminate the SSL connection from Teams.

    * ex: `https://subdomain.ngrok.io`.
    
	 NOTE: A free Ngrok plan will generate a new URL every time you run it, which requires you to update your Azure AD registration, the Teams app manifest, and the project configuration. A paid account with a permanent Ngrok URL is recommended.

Step 3: Run the app locally 
====================================
1. Clone the repository.

  		git clone “https://github.com/pnp/teams-dev-samples.git”

2. If you are using Visual Studio
 	- Launch Visual Studio.
 	- File -> Open -> Project/Solution.
 	- Navigate to samples/app-ReporterPlus.
 	- Select ReporterPlus.sln file.

3. Update the appsettings.json files
      - `MicrosoftAppId` & `TenantId` from the Step-1 Point-2.
      - `MicrosoftAppPassword` from Step-1 Point-3.
      - `ServiceUrl` is the URL sent by Teams in the Bot payload in the turnContext.Activity.serviceUrl property, debug the project to get the URL.
      - `BaseUrl` is the ngrok url that has been generated for the tunneling service as described in the Step-3 Point-4.
      - `OriginatorId` from Step-1 Point-8.
      - `SenderEmail` with the email that you have provided to create an Originator Id in the Step-1 Point-8.

4. Run Ngrok to expose your local web server via a public URL. Make sure to point it to your Ngrok URI. For example, if you're using port 3978 locally, run:

		Win: ngrok http 3978 -host-header=localhost:3978 -subdomain="contoso"
		Mac: ngrok http 3978 -host-header=localhost:3978 -subdomain="contoso".

Open the Bot channel registration, click on Configuration/Settings on the left pane, whichever is available and update the messaging endpoint to the endpoint that bot app will be listening on. Update the ngrok URL in the below format for the messaging endpoint.

		ex: https://<subdomain>.ngrok.io/api/messages.

* Scan QR / Bar code to accept input for the asset.
* Use the ‘Assign’ button to invoke people picker and select a user for approving your request.
* Use camera to take pictures  (maximum of 5) and add it to your request.
