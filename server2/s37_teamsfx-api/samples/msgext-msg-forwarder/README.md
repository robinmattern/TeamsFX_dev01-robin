## Minimal Path to Awesome

* Clone this repository
* in the command line run:
  * `npm install`
  * `npm i -g gulp-cli`
  * `gulp ngrok-serve`
* This will give your ngrok url, which can  be used in below steps
* Register a bot and Azure AD application (Steps mentoined below)
* With gulp ngrok-serve, it will auto create teams app manifest file package. Just make sure that the manifest file correct reference to your ngrok url.

## Features
This Teams app will provide way to forward a message to any users or teamms channel directly from current chat converstion. This Teams App sample illustrates the following concepts:

* Action based Messaging Extension Teams App (Task Module)
* Implementing SSO in Action based Messaging Extension
* Using MGT Graph Toolkit inside Messaging Extension Task Module
* Making Graph API calls using MGT Provider with SSO

## Create Azure AD App Registration
As we are using Graph API and SSO, we need to setup new Azure AD app registration. 

* To create a new Azure AD App registration with SSO refer this [link](https://pnp.github.io/generator-teams/tutorials/build-a-tab-with-sso-support/#set-up-your-azure-ad-application) 
* For making graph call using Microsoft Graph Toolkit with SSO, we would need to do addtional steps in Azure AD app to make sure Graph API token is retrieved and we get required constent and permissoins. You can refer this [link](https://blog.mastykarz.nl/securely-connect-microsoft-graph-teams-tabs-sso/) from Waldek on same to understand the concept. Please note that the code is already implemented in this solution. so you need to just do configuration in Azure AD app registration.

## Create Azure Bot Regisration
As we have to use messaging extension, we need to register a Azure Bot.

* Go to portal.azure.com
* Create new Azure Bot
* When Asked for Azure App ID choose existing one and enter Azure App Regisration client id and secret from previous step
* Enable Bot channel for Teams
* Replace the API messaging endpoint with your ngrok url after you ran.

## Replace client ID for provider

* Inside the file msgext-msg-forwarder\src\client\forwardMessageMessageExtension\ForwardMessageMessageExtensionAction.tsx
* Replace the clientId with your client ID

## Enviornment Variable file

Create a .env file at the root of the solution(when you will clone, this file won't be created automatically) and then copy below content in this file. If you are deploying to Azure, make sure you have below variable entries in configuration.
