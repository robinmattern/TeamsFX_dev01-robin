# Giphy Search Messaging Extension


Search based *Messaging extensions* allow users to interact with your web service through buttons and forms in the Microsoft Teams client. They can search, in an external system from the compose message area.

## Summary

This sample is a search-based messaging extension created using the [Microsoft Teams Toolkit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamsDevApp.ms-teams-vscode-extension).
This app will allow searching a GIF based on a search keyword and can tap on an item to add it into the message composing area.
This is the same functionlity as GIPHY app, although the search api can be more regulated.

**Configure Ngrok**

Your app will be run from a localhost server. You will need to setup Ngrok in order to tunnel from the Teams client to localhost. 

**Run Ngrok**

Run ngrok - point to port 3978

`ngrok http -host-header=rewrite 3978`

**Update Bot Framework Messaging Endpoint**

  Note: You can also do this with the Manifest Editor in App Studio if you are familiar with the process.

- For the Messaging endpoint URL, use the current `https` URL you were given by running ngrok and append it with the path `/api/messages`. It should like something work `https://{subdomain}.ngrok.io/api/messages`.

- Click on the `Bots` menu item from the toolkit and select the bot you are using for this project.  Update the messaging endpoint and press enter to save the value in the Bot Framework.

- Ensure that you've [enabled the Teams Channel](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/channel-connect-teams?view=azure-bot-service-4.0)
