# Tab Meeting Details - Microsoft Teams App

Teams meeting app showing up in (theoretically) any context and displaying details about the meeting and current participant.

## Summary

This sample is a Teams meeting app created using the Teams Yeoman Generator. It's a tab showing up in (theoretically) any context and displaying details about the meeting and current participant.

## Minimal Path to Awesome
- Clone the repository
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/pnp/teams-dev-samples.git
    ```

- In a console, navigate to `/samples/tab-meeting-details`

    ```bash
    cd /samples/tab-meeting-details
    ```

- Install modules

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
- You will need to register a Bot Channel for this app by executing the following steps
    - Go to our Azure portal and Bot Services and click "Create"
    - Pick "Azure Bot"
    - Once again click the "Create" button inside
    - Choose a valid name, subscription and resource group
    - Free pricing tier is sufficient in this experimental phase
    - Either create a Microsoft App ID on your own or let the Bot create it for you
    (In the latter case you will get a secret which will be stored in an own Azure Key Vault, pay attention to clean up if you do not use that)
    - Having the bot created, open the resource and under "Channels" add a featured "Teams channel". 
    - Furthermore under Configuration add the following messaging endpoint: https://xxxxx.ngrok.io/api/messages 
    (Later the xxxxx will be exchanged by the real given random ngrok url received)
    - On the "Configuration" tab click "Manage" beside the Microsoft App ID and generate a new secret and note this down
    - Paste App ID and secret into you local .env file got from .env-sample

## Additional build options

You can use the following flags for the `serve`, `ngrok-serve` and build commands:

* `--no-linting` or `-l` - skips the linting of Typescript during build to improve build times
* `--debug` - builds in debug mode and significantly improves build time with support for hot reloading of client side components
* `--env <filename>.env` - use an alternate set of environment files
* `--publish` - automatically publish the application to the Teams App store

## Deployment

The solution can be deployed to Azure using any deployment method.

* For Azure Devops see [How to deploy a Yo Teams generated project to Azure through Azure DevOps](https://www.wictorwilen.se/blog/deploying-yo-teams-and-node-apps/)
* For Docker containers, see the included `Dockerfile`

## Logging

To enable logging for the solution you need to add `msteams` to the `DEBUG` environment variable. See the [debug package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug) for more information. By default this setting is turned on in the `.env` file.

Example for Windows command line:

``` bash
SET DEBUG=msteams
```

If you are using Microsoft Azure to host your Microsoft Teams app, then you can add `DEBUG` as an Application Setting with the value of `msteams`.
