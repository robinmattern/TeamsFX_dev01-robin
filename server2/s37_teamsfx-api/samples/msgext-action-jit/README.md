## Minimal Path to Awesome

- Clone the repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/PnP/teams-dev-samples.git
    ```

- In a console, navigate to `samples/msgext-action-jit`

    ```bash
    cd samples/msgext-action-jit
    ```

- Install modules

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    or

    ```bash
    yarn
    ```

- Run ngrok - point to port 3007

    ```bash
    ngrok http -host-header=rewrite 3007
    ```

- Since messaging extensions utilize the Azure Bot Framework, you will need to register a new bot.
[These instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/bots/how-to/create-a-bot-for-teams#register-your-web-service-with-the-bot-framework) provide options for registering with or without an Azure subscription. 
  - Be sure to enable the Microsoft Teams bot channel so your solution can communicate with Microsoft Teams
  - For local testing, set the messaging endpoint to the https URL returned by ngrok plus "/api/messages"
  - Note the bot's Application ID and password (also called the Client Secret) assigned to your bot during the registration process. In the Azure portal this is under the Bot Registration settings; in the legacy portal it's in the Settings tab. Click Manage to go to Azure AD to obtain the Client Secret. You may need to create a new Application Secret in order to have an opportunity to copy it out of the Azure portal.

- Update the `.env`(create from `.env.development`) configuration for the bot to use the Microsoft App Id and App Password (aka Client Secret) from the previous step. Hostname with the ngrok returned hostname like `071b0791d531.ngrok.io`

- Run the bot locally
    ```bash
    gulp dev-serve
    ```

- Upload the application package (./package folder)
  Upload the resulting zip file into Teams [using these instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/deploy-and-publish/apps-upload).

- Test in Microsoft Teams by clicking the ... beneath the compose box in a Team
